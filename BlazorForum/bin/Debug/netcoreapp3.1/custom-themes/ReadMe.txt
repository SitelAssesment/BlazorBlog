Themes can be placed here. The folder name should be the same as the theme name. 
The theme name should not contain spaces, but can contain hyphens.
The theme name cannot be more than 50 characters.
The stylesheet must be named "styles.css" and must be in the root of the theme folder (i.e /custom-themes/the-theme-name/styles.css).
The styles will simply override any default styles.
The stylesheet must contain the theme information at the top of the file.
